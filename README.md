## JWT

At a time to register, and the user do not exist, it create a new entry for the database with non cryptos. The password is encrypted when sent to backend, the backend encrypt it again and stored. When the user login, the password is sent to the backend and if found any, return the new state for the project. Saving the JWT for requesting the CRUD operations.
